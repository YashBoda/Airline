# Airline-complaint-category-tagging and sentiment analysis

A deep learning project that classifies airline reviews into sentiment and category labels using BERT and GPU acceleration, reducing computational time by 93.33%.The project also includes web scraping to gather airline review data and a Flask web app for visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Web Scraping: Automatically collects airline reviews from the web.

BERT Fine-tuning: Transformer-based model for highly accurate predictions.

Dual Classification:

Sentiment: Positive, Neutral, Negative

Category: Delay, Service, Baggage, etc.

GPU Acceleration: Optimized training for faster computation.

Visualization: Donut charts and category-wise review counts.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Python 3.10+ recommended.

GPU is optional but speeds up model inference.

The pre-trained model allows you to predict without retraining.
